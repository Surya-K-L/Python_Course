## 💡 Example Programs

Here are some sample filenames and what they demonstrate:

- `calculator.py` — Perform basic arithmetic based on user input  
- `prime_check.py` — Check if a number is prime  
- `find_max_min.py` — Find maximum and minimum in a list  
- `string_utils.py` — Reverse strings, check palindromes  

*(Filenames above are illustrative—adjust based on actual file names in your repo.)*
